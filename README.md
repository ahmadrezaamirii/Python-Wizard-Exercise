# Python Wizard Exercise
---
A wizard has two magic sets, SetA and SetB. Each of these sets contains a number of different numbers. The wizard has two tasks:

SetA = {1, 2, 3, 4}

SetB = {3, 4, 5, 6}

The wizard has to identify all the members in both sets.

He has to find the common set between SetA and SetB.

Your task is to write a program that:

Find the common set of members in both sets, denoted by u.

Find the common set between SetA and SetB, denoted by i.

The output displays the output of cases 1 and 2, respectively, on 2 lines, as follows.

{common}
{share}
***
### Define the sets
````
SetA = {1, 2, 3, 4}

SetB = {3, 4, 5, 6}
````
### Find union and intersection
````
u = SetA.union(SetB)       # or: u = SetA | SetB
i = SetA.intersection(SetB) # or: i = SetA & SetB
````
### Display the results
````
print(u)
print(i)
````
